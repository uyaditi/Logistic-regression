# Logistic Regression Machine Learning README

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing Logistic Regression using Python. Logistic Regression is a popular classification algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for binary classification problems, but can also be extended to handle multi-class classification tasks.

## Project Structure

The project contains a single Jupyter Notebook, `ML-logistic-regression.ipynb`, which demonstrates various implementations of Logistic Regression on different datasets.

### 1. Logistic Regression on Synthetic Dataset (From Scratch)

In this section of the notebook, we implement Logistic Regression from scratch on a synthetic dataset. The code showcases how to train a logistic regression model, calculate the gradient, and update the model parameters using gradient descent. It provides a hands-on understanding of the inner workings of the algorithm.

### 2. Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset (Multiclass Classification)

In this section, we use Logistic Regression to perform multiclass classification on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various iris flowers, classified into three different species. We demonstrate how to preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance for multiclass classification.

### 3. Logistic Regression on Airlines Passenger Dataset (With and Without Regularization)

This section focuses on logistic regression applied to the Airlines Passenger dataset. We explore two variations: logistic regression without regularization and logistic regression with regularization. The dataset contains information about airline passengers and whether or not they churned. We analyze the impact of regularization on model performance and showcase the importance of regularization in preventing overfitting.

## Getting Started

To run the code in the notebook:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install the required libraries, if any, mentioned in the notebook.
4. Open the `ML-logistic-regression.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Execute the code cells sequentially to understand and run the logistic regression implementations.
